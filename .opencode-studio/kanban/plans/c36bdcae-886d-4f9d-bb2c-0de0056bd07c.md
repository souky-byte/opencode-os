# Planning: Ahoj

**Task ID:** c36bdcae-886d-4f9d-bb2c-0de0056bd07c
**Created:** 2025-12-31

---

## 1. Technical Analysis

**Status: BLOCKED - Insufficient Specification**

The task title "Ahoj" and description "Ahoj" contain no actionable requirements. "Ahoj" is a Czech/Slovak greeting meaning "Hello" - this appears to be either:
- A test/placeholder task
- An incomplete task submission
- A greeting intended for a human, not a task specification

**No technical analysis possible** without understanding:
- What feature, fix, or change is requested?
- What problem needs to be solved?
- What is the expected outcome?

---

## 2. Files to Modify/Create

**Unknown** - Cannot determine without task specification.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation

**Cannot be determined** - No requirements provided.

---

## 4. Potential Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Implementing without clear requirements | High | Request clarification before proceeding |
| Misinterpreting intent | High | Confirm understanding with stakeholder |

---

## 5. Estimated Complexity

**N/A** - Cannot estimate without understanding scope.

---

## Recommendation

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Please provide a clear task description that includes:
1. What needs to be done (feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
2. Where in the codebase this applies
3. Expected behavior or outcome
4. Any relevant context or constraints

Once specification is provided, this plan will be updated with actionable implementation steps.
