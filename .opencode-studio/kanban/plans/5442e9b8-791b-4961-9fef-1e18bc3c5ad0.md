# Planning Analysis: Ahoj

**Task ID:** 5442e9b8-791b-4961-9fef-1e18bc3c5ad0
**Created:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** BLOCKED - Insufficient Information

---

## 1. Technical Analysis

### Current State
The task contains only a greeting ("Ahoj") with no actionable requirements.

### Problem Statement
**UNABLE TO PLAN** - The task description does not specify:
- What feature/fix is needed
- Which part of the codebase is involved
- What the expected outcome should be
- Any acceptance criteria

### Assessment
This appears to be either:
1. A test task created accidentally
2. A placeholder that needs proper description
3. A greeting intended as a message, not a task

---

## 2. Files to Modify/Create

**Cannot determine** - No requirements specified.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Clarify Requirements** - Task owner must provide:
   - Clear description of what needs to be done
   - Expected behavior/outcome
   - Any relevant context (error messages, user stories, etc.)

2. **Re-plan** - Once requirements are clear, create a proper implementation plan

---

## 4. Potential Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Implementing wrong feature | High | Get clarification before proceeding |
| Wasted development time | Medium | Block task until requirements defined |

---

## 5. Estimated Complexity

**UNDETERMINED** - Cannot estimate without requirements.

---

## Recommendation

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Please update this task with a proper description including:
- What you want to accomplish
- Why it's needed
- Any specific technical requirements or constraints

Once updated, this task can be re-planned with concrete implementation steps.
